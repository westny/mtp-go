#### Hardware requirements

The original implementation make use of a considerable amount of data (some gigabytes worth) for training and testing which can be demanding for some setups. For you reference all code has been tried and used on a computer with the following specs:
```
* Processor: IntelÂ® Xeon(R) E-2144G CPU @ 3.60GHz x 8
* Memory: 32 GB
* GPU: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 [GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Rev. A]
```
